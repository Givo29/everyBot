## Vision

*everybot* aims to go where no discord bot has gone before

To create a **community driven**, completely **modular** and fully **centralised** discord bot. 

## So why a new bot?

The [mee6](https://mee6.xyz/) bot is both modular and centralised. But not community driven - only having a limited amount of modules available for use

[Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) bot is fully modular and allows you to create your own cogs, but is self hosted only. 

*everyBot* intends to create something new. By combining the best parts (Community driven, Modular and fully hosted by us) and encouraging community members to create and maintain their own modules, for all to use, without the restriction of everyone having to setup and host the bot themselves. 

## How To Contribute
At this moment there is no way to easily create new modules for the bot, but that is coming soon in the form of a contributing guide and docker image.

The best way to help at this time is to invite the bot to your Discord server and start using it! Submitting bugs or feedback via a Github issue is the best way to contribute to the project.

## Is it functional?
